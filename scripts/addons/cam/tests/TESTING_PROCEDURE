1. Running the tests

> python test-suite.py

The script will go through each blend file, generate GCode for all operations and compare the results with the reference.


2. Creating new tests

> cd test_data
> mkdir name_of_your_test
> blender name_of_your_blend_file (can be the same name as the subdirectory)

Create as many operations as necessary using BlenderCAM
Generate the corresponding GCode with "Calculate Path and export GCode"
Rename the generated files by adding an underscore at the beginning:
> mv Op1.gcode _Op1.gcode

Commit and push
